01 - First Class
============================

Constructor exists by default but it's empty.
Define the constructor allows to initialize the object at the instanciation.

Into Class, we can have :
- properties with scoped
- methods with scoped
- constructors to initialize the object

Best practice :
- 1 file by class
- See the [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) to see how respect code style

To instanciate an object from the class, use the key word : **new** (look at index.php to view how to do)
