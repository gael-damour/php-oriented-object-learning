03 - Properties and Method Scope
===============================

That define when we can access to the property or method. This is the scope.

- **public** : Allow to access inside and outside the class
- **protected** : Allow to access inside class and childs class which inherit it. 
- **private** : Allow to access inside the class only

...To access a protected or private property, we usually use a getter that returns the property.
...Tu mutate a protected or private property, we usually use a setter that takes the value to assign in paramaters.
