01 - Les objets - DÃ©finition
============================

We know Integer, String, Boolean and Array.
But it's not sufficient because we'll need to handle complexe informations like an user account with rights. That's why it exists another type of variable : Object.

An object is an representation of anything. An object contains characteristics and functionalities. Imagine a pen: A pen can have a color, a type of pen (characteristic) and can write (functionality). An object can be a representation of this pen!

With the objects, the code can be better organized. 
Better yet, an object can interact with other objects.

The Oriented Object Programming is, in fact, a [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

In POO, the Class is the definition, the Object is the instantiation
Exemple : 
`$object = new Class();`
$object is the instantiation of class Class.

An object has properties (characteristics) and methods (functionalities).
